# ShinyApp-Judgmental-Forecasting

This is a shiny app designed to investigate the value of judgmental forecasts incorporated by experts. You can see the app at https://mahdiforecasting.shinyapps.io/Prediction/


The purpose of this study is to analyse if experts' judgment can add value to the statistical forecasts. 
We use the real-world time series where they are blended with promotions. Participants were given 24 different sales series representing the actual sales of different products in a company. Each series has 24 observations with different scales of sales, promotion status, and sales uplifts due to promotion. The experiment is meant to test the impact of different variables and models in building a better Decision Support System.
